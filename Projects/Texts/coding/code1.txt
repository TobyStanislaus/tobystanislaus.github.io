<h1 class="highlighted-points">Starting Out</h1>
My love for Python began in September 2022. Eager to create, I began to learn the language.

<h1 class="highlighted-points">Tkinter and Projects</h1>
My first project using Tkinter was a calculator. My learning goals included recreating the Monty Hall problem and developing a program for signing boats (see the Sailing-ML tab for more). 

Understanding the Monty Hall problem:

You choose one of three doors, behind which are two goats and one car. After your choice, the host reveals a goat behind one of the other doors. Should you switch your choice? (Hint: Yes, always switch.)

Despite my initial code being a mess of over 500 lines, it worked and demonstrated the probability of winning by switching doors. I was proud of what I made, through my logic.

<h1 class="highlighted-points">Coding Quest</h1>
I participated in 'Coding Quest', a challenge for A-level students, involving array manipulation, simulating the snake game, index trees, and Dijkstra's algorithm. 

Out of the entire school, only two students completed it: a Year 13 student and me, a Year 10 student. I finished second in my school and sixth form.

<h1 class="highlighted-points">LeetCode</h1>
To further my skills, I tackled more intermediate challenges on LeetCode. 
You can see my stats as of Year 10 on the right.

I look forward to participating in additional extracurricular coding challenges.
