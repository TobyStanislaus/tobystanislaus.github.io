From ages 9 to 14, I participated in Parkrun, a weekly 5k run on Saturdays (or 2k for kids on Sundays). It was a great way to meet fellow runners and enjoy friendly competition.

When I started, my goal was to run a sub-25 minute 5k, improving from my initial 30-minute time. By attending Parkrun weekly, I eventually brought my time down to 21 minutes, surpassing my target.

I volunteered at Parkrun for about three months, assisting with tasks such as timing runners, logging participants, and marshalling. 

This enriching experience involved waking up at 7:30 on Saturdays, regardless of the weather, and interacting and assiting many runners.

Learning to perform these tasks each week allowed me to give back to the organization that helped shape my running journey and mentality.
