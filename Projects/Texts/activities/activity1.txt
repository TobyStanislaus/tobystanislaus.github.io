Since age 13, I've been race sailing with a partner, navigating and utilising the wind to go as quickly as possible. 

Racing demands control and composure, especially with nearby sailors, which requires critical communication. 

Sailing has been a fantastic way to socialize, stay fit, and strengthen my mental resilience. In the photo, I'm in the front boat, hanging out to control it.

At school, I played as a winger on the Rugby team, requiring teamwork and determination. We won the national schools Rugby league, which involved weekly 90-minute practices.

The first picture shows us after finishing second in a Year 7 tournament out of nine schools. 
The second picture is from Year 10 after an undefeated season (I'm kneeling on the bottom right in both).

From ages 6 to 13, I played for Chippenham Barca FC and Chippenham Milan FC. Football taught me the importance of teamwork in achieving goals. 

This mentality has carried over to my academic success, thanks to collaboration with peers.

I also played as a defender for school from Years 7 to 11, requiring hard work to prevent goals. This role helped me branch out socially, with weekly 90-minute practice sessions.
