    <h2>The Task</h2>
I was responsible for developing the integration between Netbox and the DenseWare website NMS. This involved building requests to the Netbox REST APIs using the Python Requests module.

To ensure efficient data retrieval, I implemented functionality to filter the data fetched from the Netbox APIs, allowing queries by specific parameters such as manufacturers.

Additionally, I created a user-friendly UI feature that enabled the passing of arguments during script execution for essential features like data filtering. This was accomplished using the Python library ArgParse.

Throughout the project, I developed unit tests to ensure robust performance of my programs. I also maintained alignment with assigned tasks by regularly updating JIRA tickets.

Emphasizing the importance of clean and readable code, I utilized the flake8 linter extension in Visual Studio Code, ensuring my code met professional standards.

    <h2>The Task</h2>
I combined approximately 30 Excel data sheets containing tens of thousands of records of building estates. 

The goal was to generate meaningful data that the sales team could use to more effectively market our product to potential customers in need.

To efficiently complete this task, I utilized PowerQuery.
