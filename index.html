Welcome! I'm Toby Stanislaus, a passionate young computer scientist keen to understand and solve real world problems.

Over the last two years I have been developing my interest in software development through my investigations
into machine learning and have created this website to showcase my skills and projects.

Initially proficient in Python, I've expanded my knowledge to include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I used to
build this site. My goal is to make it both user-friendly and visually appealing.
  
Explore the tabs above to see a selection of my projects, including 'Sailing-ML' which integrates my 
Python-based machine learning work. You'll also find an 'Experience' section detailing my work, coding journey, 
and various activities.
  
This website serves as both my interactive CV and a testament to my dedication to continuous learning and 
improvement in programming.

Thank you for visiting!
